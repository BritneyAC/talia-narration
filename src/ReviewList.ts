      Wow, I am just amazed by how much I enjoyed Egan and Raiden brought to life. The voice fit perfectly and being able to visualize this book while someone else narrated it was just the icing on the cake!`,

      What a beautiful story told by such a wonderful narrator! Not only did McQueen create a wholesome tale of shape shifting into dragons, princes, and LGBT romance, but the narrator brought the entire story to life with his beautiful narration of Raiden and Egan!

      Worth every wholesome second! `,
